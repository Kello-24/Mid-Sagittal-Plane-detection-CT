# Data Documentation for Mid-Sagittal Plane Detection Project

This README file provides an overview of the data used in the Mid-Sagittal Plane Detection project.

## Datasets

The project utilizes medical imaging datasets, specifically NIfTI (Neuroimaging Informatics Technology Initiative) format files. These datasets may include various anatomical structures relevant to mid-sagittal plane detection.

### Data Formats

- **NIfTI (.nii, .nii.gz)**: The primary format for the medical images used in this project. These files contain volumetric data and associated metadata.

## Preprocessing Steps

Before using the datasets in the analysis, the following preprocessing steps are typically performed:

1. **Loading Data**: The NIfTI files are loaded using appropriate libraries (e.g., nibabel).
2. **Reorientation**: The image data is reoriented to a standard orientation (coronal, sagittal, axial) for consistency.
3. **Masking**: Binary masks may be created to isolate specific anatomical structures based on Hounsfield Units (HU) or other criteria.
4. **Cropping**: The images may be cropped to focus on relevant regions of interest, such as the mid-sagittal plane.

## Usage

Ensure that the datasets are placed in the appropriate directory structure as specified in the project. Follow the instructions in the main README file for further details on how to run the analysis and visualize the results.
